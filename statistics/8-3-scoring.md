>> This way of making an estimate is biased. This method works the best when lambda is small and the number of goals approximates a Poisson distribution. In which case, the estimates are highly accurate and this estimation method is recommended. However, when lambda is large, the number of goals approximate a normal distribution, resulting in large estimation errors. In contrast, when lambda is extremely small, the estimate will almost always be zero, which does not yield useful estimates either even though the calculated error may seem small. In addition, this method uses discrete statistics (*number of goals*) to estimate a continuous number (*lambda*); it does not always give the most accurate estimates.
