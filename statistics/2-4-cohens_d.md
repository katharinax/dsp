[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> Based on Cohen’s d, the difference in mean weights between first and other babies is -0.089 standard deviations. Though -0.089 is slightly bigger in absolute value than the Cohen’s d for mean pregnancy lengths, it is still a fairly small difference, which is statistically insignificant. It cannot be concluded that first babies are lighter or heavier than others.
