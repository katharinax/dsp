[Think Stats Chapter 6 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2007.html#toc60) (household income)

>> Median = $51,226.93 USD  
>>   
>> Mean = $74,278.71 USD  
>>   
>> Looking at the distribution symmetry, the skewness is 4.95  
>>   
>> Looking at the difference between mean and median, the Pearsonâ€™s skewness is 0.736  
>>   
>> There are 66.0% of households reported a taxable income below the mean.  
>>   
>> *How do the results depend on the assumed upper bound?* Ans: Changing the upper bound changes the individual household income that gets interpolated, which in turn factors into calculating the mean of the household income. As a result, when the value of the mean changes, the percent of population below that boundary shifts accordingly.
